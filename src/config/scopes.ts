 * The app-identity scopes this bridge needs (design §9). Single source of

 * Feishu has **no API to declare app scopes**: the scan-create flow
 * (`registerApp`) takes no permission argument, and so does the official
 * larksuite/cli. The only way to grant them is the developer-console
 * "apply scope" page. So instead of baking scopes into the QR (impossible),
 * we point the user at one console URL that pre-selects *all* of these at
 * once — scan once, click once. See {@link buildScopeGrantUrl}.
 *
 * Cloud-doc comment scopes live in {@link COMMENT_SCOPES}, NOT here: the
 * comment-reply feature is an opt-in enhancement, so it must never block the
 * daemon-install scope gate (which loops on REQUIRED_SCOPES until granted).

 * user who wants the feature gets them in the same click, but deliberately NOT
 * in {@link REQUIRED_SCOPES}: the daemon-install gate loops on REQUIRED_SCOPES
 * until granted, and we must not block the (messaging) bot on an opt-in extra.
 * Without these, the comment event simply isn't pushed / the API calls fail and
 * we log + skip — everything else still works.
 *
 * Names are exact Feishu fine-grained tokens (verified against the API docs +
 * the official lark CLI scope registry). `:read` covers reading the comment AND
 * receiving the `drive.notice.comment_add_v1` event; `:create` covers posting
 * the reply and the comment "Typing" reaction; `wiki:wiki:readonly` (umbrella
 * readonly — chosen over the fine-grained `wiki:node:read` to dodge the
 * singular/plural scope-name pitfall, cf. c6317e7) resolves knowledge-base
 * (wiki) nodes to their underlying doc token.
